# MLOps Learning Plan

<br><br>

### **Phase 1: Strengthen Foundational Skills (1-2 months)**  

**1. Python for MLOps**  
- Deepen your Python knowledge, focusing on ML and data manipulation libraries like numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.  
- Resource: [Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/), [Kaggle Python tutorials](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python).  

**2. Linux for MLOps**  
- Learn to automate tasks and manage resources relevant to ML workflows (e.g., scheduling jobs, handling large datasets).  
- Resource: [The Linux Command Line by William Shotts](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php).  

**3. Docker and Kubernetes**  
- Expand your knowledge by focusing on containerizing ML models and deploying them using Kubernetes.  
- Key topics: Multi-stage Docker builds, Helm charts, Kubernetes services.  
- Resource: [Docker for Data Science](https://dockerfordatascience.com), [Kubernetes official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

### **Phase 2: Learn MLOps-Specific Tools (2-3 months)**  

**1. ML Basics**  
- Understand basic ML workflows, from data preprocessing to training and evaluation.  
- Hands-on: Use Scikit-learn or TensorFlow to build and deploy a simple ML model.  
- Resource: [Andrew Ngâ€™s Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).  

**2. Model Deployment and Serving**  
- Focus on serving models using TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, or FastAPI.  
- Learn how to use Dockerized APIs to serve models.  
- Resource: [Serving ML Models with FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/).  

**3. Monitoring and Observability**  
- Study Prometheus and Grafana to monitor deployed models and resources.  
- Learn how to track model performance metrics like latency and drift.

### **Phase 3: Build Cloud Expertise for MLOps (2-3 months)**  

**1. AWS and ML Services**  
- Leverage your AWS SysOps training to explore AWS ML services (e.g., SageMaker, Lambda for model inference).  
- Hands-on: Deploy an ML model on SageMaker, set up model inference endpoints.  
- Resource: [AWS SageMaker Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).  

**2. Infrastructure as Code**  
- Expand your Terraform knowledge to automate the deployment of ML pipelines and infrastructure.  
- Resource: [Terraform Up & Running by Yevgeniy Brikman](https://www.terraformupandrunning.com/).  

**3. Data Pipelines**  
- Learn Apache Airflow or Prefect to orchestrate end-to-end ML workflows.  
- Resource: [Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Pipelines-Apache-Airflow-infrastructure/dp/1492055663).  

---

### **Phase 4: Integrate DevOps and MLOps Practices (Ongoing)**  

**1. CI/CD for ML**  
- Create pipelines for model versioning, retraining, and testing using Jenkins or GitHub Actions.  
- Focus on automating deployment using Docker and Kubernetes.  

**2. Experiment Tracking**  
- Learn tools like MLflow or Weights & Biases to track experiments and manage model versions.  
- Resource: [MLflow Documentation](https://mlflow.org/).  

**3. Real-World Project**  
- Develop a project that integrates DevOps and MLOps skills:  
  - Example: Build and deploy an end-to-end ML pipeline with CI/CD, model monitoring, and automated retraining.
